Sounds like Brooks is going to try and run more stuff for Beal, and will likely start small with Morris and Scott. He doesn't have many options, honestly. The Raptors are just better.

I don\u2019t know how, but the Wizards need to get from under the Gortat and\/or Mahnimi contract. Keep the core around though. Hard to build like the Raptors, when most of their bench came from the draft, but they need to find good bench players.

Generic offense built around two guards. Generic cuts and off-ball movement without making role players a real threat. Offense will peak out and fizzle. Sound familiar? Maybe like the Raptors the past few years before this one?

The Bucks Center position as a whole is really bad. I think most Bucks fans would rather see Thon out there than Henson. Last year against the Raptors Thon Started 6 games and played over 100 minutes compared to 12 minutes from Henson in the series.

The Raptors are up 2-0 in a postseason series for the first time.\n\nSince playoff seeding started in 1983-84, seeds are 48-1 in 1st Round series with a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe only loss was the 1993-94 SuperSonics (lost to the Nuggets in a 5-game series).

Lets see what happens. I still think Cleveland is the team to beat but if Indiana takes them out imo Toronto is the best team left. Philly is on the rise but imo still too young. Don't see them beating the Raptors 4 times in a series tbh.
