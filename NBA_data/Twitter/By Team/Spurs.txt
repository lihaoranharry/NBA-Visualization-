Agreed. Feels like 1-2 young players + 1st rd pick has been the going rate for star players over the past year. Kuzma and Ingram probably have higher ceilings than any other young player sans Oladipo. Would be a great talent reset for the Spurs too.

It's certainly going to be a massive summer of change in north London. Arsenal with a new manager, Spurs with a new stadium. Wenger had a big impact on English football despite probably outstaying his welcome by a few years. Which side will now push on in the transfer market?

I agree that Spurs are a very attractive project at the moment, with moving into the new stadium next year, they'll need to put trophies next to it if players like Kane\/Alderweireld are to buy into it and hence avoid the same transition problems Arsenal had at the Emirates.

It could be, there\u2019s a lot missing from that squad at the moment though. Realistically, you\u2019re looking at a need to sign 4 or 5 players for the starting XI, which is a lot. It\u2019ll take time. I think Spurs are more of a safe bet than Arsenal at the moment

FA get a lot of criticisme for Spurs \"home-leg\" at Wembley in the semi, not played at Villa Park for ex. Their answer is putting a Manchester ref, Anthony Taylor, United have never lost a cup match with him, to balance the books. Pathetic, put all your money on Mourinho. Corrupt.

Men, Kawhi is not going to be FA. After what happened this season, Spurs decide the future this Summer. If they don't offer Kawhi an extension ir if he does not wanna sign nos, they will tarde him. To much value and franchise to let him walk for nothing in one year. IMO.

The Spurs aren\u2019t giving Kawhi up for RoCo and a couple of draft picks. You don\u2019t think there\u2019s another team in the NBA that would offer more than that? Would have to include Saric or Fultz in the deal.

That\u2019s been the problem with the Spurs. They need more than Kawhi if they want to win a championship. People can\u2019t put everything on Kawhi, it\u2019s not his fault the roster has a bunch of aging veterans while other teams have multiple stars. Aldridge is not enough.
