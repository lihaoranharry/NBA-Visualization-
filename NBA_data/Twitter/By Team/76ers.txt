Part 2. Of the game. Which is why the NBA is trying to prevent it from happening and why they fined Cuban for his comments. My argument is the Pacers are not in that worse of position from 76ers and they have always tried to win instead of trying to lose.

Disagree - it\u2019s about delayed gratification - who cares how bad basketball was for 3 years ? Not the vast majority of 76ers fans - rather be dreadful for 3 years and have 2 transcend talents than finish 41-41 every year with little hope of meaningful basketball

Did Golden State need Durant? Championship experience is the only missing ingredient for the 76ers. Plus LeBron is tremendous insurance against any further Embid injuries. Just imagine LeBron playing off Simmons passes...
