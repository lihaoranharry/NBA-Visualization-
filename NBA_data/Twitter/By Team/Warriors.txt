The Warriors have TWO MVPs in their primes, 2 other All-NBA players AND an elite bench. They're guaranteed to win the title every single season. That's why KD &amp; Curry getting hurt would be the absolute best thing that could happen for the league.

if I'm not mistaken, the Pelicans have been up double digits every game against the Warriors this season and only won the one Stephen didn't play in.

This series reminds me of 2011 when the blazers were soundly beaten by the surprise Mavericks who nobody picked to win a championship that year. These Pelicans are for real. Warriors series will be very interesting...

that the Pelicans gon give the Warriors some problems next round the way Rondo and Holiday playing.... Especially with Steph being out even longer. Not saying they\u2019d beat them but they can take em to 6 or maybe 7 without Steph Curry on the court.\n\nWarriors haven\u2019t been impressive
Fri Apr 20 18:39:18 +0000 201
The Warriors will not lose in the second round Stephen A . The Warriors still have enough talent with KD , Green &amp; Thompson . If they are going to be in trouble it will be against the Rockets . All that would mean is that the Warriors will have a smaller margin for error .
Fri Apr 20 18:39:22 +0000 201
I know it's depressing af, but nobody's touching the Warriors. If you think AD and Playoff Rondo is going to take them to the 6 or 7, you are either blinded or delusional. Curry will come back next round no doubt about it.

Two back-to-back bizarre statements. Warriors are done w\/our Steph for a couple games? No! NBA is scripted? So AD will just throw a game b\/c the NBA scripted it? Seriously? However, the NBA might elect not to push up the series a couple days for max Steph ratings.
