One reason I hate going off a labeled result -- such as WCF appearance in making big decisions. You have to look at the result in context -- they struggled vs Memphis &amp; won a coin flip game 5 vs a meh Rockets team. It's been obvious there's been major flaws on the roster.

All yall calling these Celtics plumbers are ignorant. Just cause they are white doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t ballers. These guys beat the Showtime lakers in the finals, Magic\/Kareem\/Worthy\/Cooper\/McAdoo. Beat the Rockets with Malone &amp; later Olajuwon. Also beat the Pistons in the CF.

[2] on the wing.. the Rockets then give up a middle drive and kick but Green does a good job contesting the corner 3 on the weakside.. Lastly, Johnson comes all the way from the wing and gets a body on Dieng when the shot goes up and the Rockets end the possession with a rebound

KAT vs the Rockets in the regular season: 22p 16r, 35p 12r, 18p 13r, 20p 18r. He torched the Rockets in the regular season. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all on the Rockets defense for his terrible play in the playoffs but it\u2019s a big reason. They deserve more credit than being given rn.

Somewhat. I agree he needs post touches especially with the mismatches the Rockets are giving him. But, he was the 2nd most efficient scorer in the regular season with just 4 post ups per game. They can't understand a big being more comfortable off the block

Also, the Rockets won 22 games in a row in that season and by the end of it were only in first place by one or two games. Playing .500 ball for 10 games after your starting center got injured would drop you from 1st to 4th.

Eh I beg to differ. I think it\u2019s all scheme and coaching. Obviously those guys good players but it\u2019s all one on one ball. Hard to win that way. Look at Rockets. Played 3 ball for past 3 years couldn\u2019t win. Then you get cp3 and it changes
