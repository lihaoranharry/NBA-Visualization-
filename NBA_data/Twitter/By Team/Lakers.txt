I wonder what its like being an NBA super star. You have the slightest bit of controversy on your team close to a free agent year and all of a sudden, according to the media, you're a top prospect to sign with the Lakers that summer

Kawhi is not worth trading for especially this year after he gave up on the Spurs. I don't wanna hear he is hurt because he got cleared by the Spurs Medical staff. Plus he is not vocal at all and would bring down the mood of the Lakers

you don\u2019t understand The Process. Embiid and Simmons were products of tanking. Covington, TJ, Holmes, a top protected pick from the Lakers, the never ending Kings pick swaps (both would become Fultz), and Dario Saric were not. But too bad Dario is never coming over.

Regarding those Kawhi rumors, I don't think Lakers would trade Lonzo or BI...so that makes everyone else available. But I don't think it will happen. Long shot. I wanna see what we do in Free Agency.
Fri Apr 20 16:18:40 +0000 201
Definitely not probable, but if the Lakers could somehow find a way to send enough salary to at least match Kawhi's incoming $20 million (Deng would basically have to be included, which SAS wouldn't want) then they would still have enough cap space to chase both PG &amp; LBJ https:\/\/t.co\/FlgOGZJZH6

I'm big on depth, young deep and by NBA standards, cheap core. It allows you to add like GS did, rather than add and subtract as trades do. No reason to trade for Kawhi as I see it, given his injury and impending free agency. Lakers can add a star or two through FA this yr, next

I disagree. NBA is stars league. Leonard is a top 5 talent. Lakers should definitely pursue him. He will attract George and James. We would immediately be back in contention if we get either George or James. Just can\u2019t give up Ingram.

They DO have the cap space to absorb a little more salary on the Lakers end so they prob can leverage not giving up another player like Kuz or Ingram but the Spurs deff not gonna get lowballed on Kawhi. \n\nThat\u2019s the whole shebang in a nutshell basically \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d

No one said anything about the Lakers trading Lou Williams for a late 1st last year. Why? Because they were a rebuilding team so trading him for a pick while also improving their own draft position made sense. And that pick turned into Kuzma. Enough with the hot takes.

There's no money on the market. Lakers, Hawks, Bulls, Mavs. Lakers aren't chasing Parker. Bulls and Hawks might, but I don't think he can play with Lauri, so that leaves us and Hawks. Bucks aren't paying him. He's going to be cheaper than people think.

Exactly all need help you prove my point. Look at the roster that the Lakers won with, guys who struggled to stay in the league after their run. Wade was not on the decline at all, Kobe could have won an MVP, Kobe also beat a Celtic team with 4 All Stars with Pau basically

If we're talking Leonard, George, and James, what place does Ingram have on the team at that point? We're talking about 3 SF's who can go between SG, SF, and PF. Unless the plan is to make Ingram the Lakers PG, he has no role on the team at that point.

It\u2019s funny. Lakers fans can somehow get crushed for overrating their players\/franchise and also get crushed for pointing it out as it happens by the same people who do the first kind of criticism (and also the fan base). \n\nIt\u2019s basically my entire existence .

I also don't think there's any scenario Kawhi Leonard ends up on the Lakers. Giving up Kuz or Ingram we don't know how healthy he is. I don't see it. I think we wait until 2019..

And why assume if Kawhi ends up on the Lakers he's sacrificing winning? I gaurantee you if Kawhi ended up in the Lakers Paul George would too. And any combo of Lonzo, Kuzma, Josh Hart and\/or Julius Randle with Kawhi is a contender for years to come.

Lakers don\u2019t have the assets or at least not the group they may be willing to part with. Like Paul George, who said he wanted to go to LA, other teams stepped up and Kawhi is better player than PG is.

Lakers won't trade Lonzo. He runs the offense and has the highest ceiling. The Lakers are forward heavy and will likely sign and trade Randle with either Kuzma\/Ingram plus either Zubac Hart and maybe Deng contract if possible. They need to lose some forwards.

Muy bien. Hay que tomar en cuenta, que los Lakers en el a\u00f1o de novato de Kobe no eran ni se asemejan a los Lakers del novato Lonzo Ball, Kobe obviamente ve\u00eda menos minutos de juego, a diferencia de el Sr. Lonzo! \n https:\/\/t.co\/KQeWnw8dCl

Le probl\u00e8me c'est que le est trop conservateur, pas une t\u00eate, pas une \u00e9paule ne doit d\u00e9passer, tout ce qui est flamboyant ne doit pas se voir, en soccer \u00e0 Madrid, Ronaldo est flamboyant pourtant, Kobe Bryant \u00e9tait flamboyant et les Lakers restent les Lakers.

Zeno, andare ai Lakers equivale ad avere un contratto migliore con gli sponsor?Anche se non \u00e8 personaggio fuori dal campo?L\u2019arrivo insieme a Lebron non rischierebbe di metterlo di nuovo in secondo piano e quindi di non essere considerato come vorrebbe e andarsene dopo un anno?

Serious question... if you\u2019re the Lakers, do you give up Randle and Ingram plus a first round pick for Kawhi Leonard? A thread
Fri Apr 20 21:02:58 +0000 201
Now onto the Lakers\u2019 assets. Randle and Ingram were 2 parts of a 3 way tie for the teams leading scorer. Randle\u2019s role changed a lot throughout the season but for the last month of the season he was by far the teams best player.
Fri Apr 20 21:03:00 +0000 201
My thoughts are that the Lakers should not trade for Kawhi unless they are certain that landing Kawhi would also land them another top talent such as Lebron or Paul George.
Fri Apr 20 21:03:36 +0000 201
This is the Lakers they don't wait they get stars everyone is tradeable.. Kawhi is a top 5 player when healthy

On one hand I just read a headline that said the Lakers need to make a move for Kawhi Leonard.\n\nOn the other hand, I also read a headline that he's not the answer for the Kings.\n\nWhat world am I in?
