If playoff Rondo can roll into next season and Boogie comes back even at 90% the Pelicans are going to be SCARY next year. That offense was made for Rondo to orchestrate. Love seeing Rondo still doing his thing

Pelicans gave Blazers their absolute best shot and it was STILL that close. Losing home-court advantage sucks, but this is a winnable series for the Blazers.
Fri Apr 20 16:14:12 +0000 201
The Pelicans really are putting the Blazers in a pick-your-poison bind. Pure simplicity. Lean too far one way or another, you're either giving a Davis Lob, Jrue drive or an open three.

Yup. I just don\u2019t think the Blazers are this bad ordinarily. I know the Pelicans are a bad matchup but you would expect that this team is good enough to get at least one or two wins. They\u2019re getting beat down worse than the warriors beat them last year
Fri Apr 20 18:34:23 +0000 201
if I'm not mistaken, the Pelicans have been up double digits every game against the Warriors this season and only won the one Stephen didn't play in.
Fri Apr 20 18:34:37 +0000 201
This series reminds me of 2011 when the blazers were soundly beaten by the surprise Mavericks who nobody picked to win a championship that year. These Pelicans are for real. Warriors series will be very interesting...

I still can\u2019t believe the Blazers getting beat down by the Pelicans like this, not sure if it\u2019s the Blazers being the normal Blazers underachieving or Pelicans just being better than we thought besides having the best player in the series Anthony Davis lol Lowkey got me thinking
Fri Apr 20 18:39:17 +0000 201
that the Pelicans gon give the Warriors some problems next round the way Rondo and Holiday playing.... Especially with Steph being out even longer. Not saying they\u2019d beat them but they can take em to 6 or maybe 7 without Steph Curry on the court.\n\nWarriors haven\u2019t been impressive

Can't blame Boogie for the Pelicans not getting worse with how great Davis has been. But at the same time, you can see his flaws that have allowed them to thrive without him. Embiid doesn't have any big flaws like that.

he would ruin the Pelicans, they would prolly still win games just off the offensive power but Boogie &amp; AD neeed the ball to produce and Westbrook does some nut shit tryna pack them stats, Rondo would be nice w Paul &amp; Melo tho I think cause they need a pass first PG

Eso le iba a decir. Holiday est\u00e1 para mejor equipo defensivo y Rondo a nivelazo. Insisto, a m\u00ed los Pelicans me parecen equipazo. Aunque es obvio que Lillard est\u00e1 jugando por debajo de su nivel. Tambi\u00e9n McCollum, aunque tenga mejores % que Lillard.

This defensive and ensuing transition 3 is a good example of what the Pels have been successful doing.

That's just a miserable way of looking at the NBA - \n\nRight now we'd have a chance to beat anyone but Houston or GSW - if we win 53 games that means we'll have a decent shot at winning a playoff series - like the Pelicans are proving that is fun

Yesterday afternoon we came across firsts for the season. Saw 6 American White Pelicans, several ducks, and these Sandhill Cranes. I\u2019m feeling that soon the sky is going to erupt with millions of birds, of every type, heading north. \ud83d\ude0a https:\/\/t.co\/vZhsGOiVfa

Saw one of my favorite spring migration sights here today...a flock of American White Pelicans, doing their slow, deliberate pin-wheeling in the sky, as if for no other purpose than the sheer joy of flight. So beautiful.
