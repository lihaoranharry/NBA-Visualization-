Thank goodness they are starting Snell &amp; his 2ppg &amp; 28% shooting over a Jabari. What is Snell's upside? Its ridiculous &amp; smells of more dysfunction. Brad Stevens starts Jabari &amp; builds around his strengths. But the Celtics are a good organization.

Rodgers would go in a heartbeat if Arsenal came knocking. It\u2019s not even a question. 10 in a row is not a success or an achievement it\u2019s a formality given Celtics finances compared to rest of league. He would have an actual job to do at arsenal on probably quadruple the wages.

76ixers, Celtics or Houston Rockets are my top 3 favourites. Cavs are great but only when LeBron is on form, he\u2019s a one man team, there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll win a ring on his own. Warriors have injuries, First Curry now KDs sprained his ankle.

. I believe -TV had rights to air a select number of Celtics games annually. Gil worked some of those w. Cousy. Pretty sure this was before the formation of SportsChannel New England, the Celtics\/Whalers joint venture that became CSSNE and then .

saying that he doesn\u2019t give a shit about \u201cthis version\u201d of the Celtics is hysterical. He doesn\u2019t give a shit about any version! Both he and think the team isn\u2019t very good and not worth discussing even if Hawayrd and Irving were healthy.

Well if they\u2019re going to split up CJ &amp; Dame, this is a great summer to do it. Kawhi on the trade market. Wizards prob will split up their backcourt too. Keep an eye on the Celtics. Their young bench talent are too talented &amp; may become too good for them to retain down the line...

Nah man! If he stayed healthy he would have dragged the Bulls past the Celtics last year. Just like Lebron and the Warriors, he saves it until the playoffs when it really matters. When the tempo changes and he takes over

He didn't finish this year. And the Celtics had other great players around him. Watch what they are doing without Irving. Irving couldn't even stay healthy the whole year and the Celtics still made the playoffs. He certainly didn't lead them there
